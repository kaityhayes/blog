# blog.io
Kaity's full-stack blog app 

My app will be heavily inspired by blogs that I have used personally in the past. 
Featuring a nav bar with links to homepage, where "everyones" blog posts will be visible.
A profile link where all your personal blog posts can be viewed, along with user information.
You will be able to create a new post from the nav bar which can then be viewed on the homepage and user page.
Edit/Delete buttons will only be available once clicked on individual post and taken to that posts id page.

*least important* I would like to attempt to incorporate a settings page where color changes can be implemented 

MVP- A working full-stack application, built by you, using Node.js, Mongoose, Express and EJS
Adhere to the MVC file structure: Models, Views, Controllers
At least one model with all 7 RESTful routes and full CRUD.
‚ùó A git repository not inside the class repo.
At least one GitHub commit per day.
Be deployed online and accessible to the public via Heroku. (NOT REQUIRED!!)
A README.md file with a link to your hosted app, explanations of the technologies used, the approach was taken, unsolved problems, user stories, and notes to yourself so you can come back to your project later in the course and be able to pick up your train of thought, etc.


Project approval:
Pick a project idea.
Write user stories:
What should people be able to do on your website?
Draw wireframes:
At least one wireframe of how your site will look.
One wireframe for each view.
Make a schedule for yourself of what you want to accomplish
First day most details.
Second day less details broader strokes of what you want to accomplish.
Further: try to pick 'milestones' (check with the project markdown and determine what your project's specific MVPs will look like) and prioritize features by MVPs and stretch goals).
This takes practice so be ready to adjust your schedule. Note: You will have to make changes and adjust/adapt as you build
